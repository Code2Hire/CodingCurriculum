        <h2>Formal:</h2>
        <p>Commonly referred to as dress shoe (U.S. English) is a shoe to be worn at smart casual or more formal events. 
        A dress shoe is typically contrasted to an athletic shoe. Dress shoes are worn by many as their standard daily shoes, 
        and are widely used in dance, for parties, and for special occasions.</p>

        <h3>Colors</h3>
        
        Men's dress shoes are most commonly black or brown. Cordovan or oxblood dress shoes are worn by men sometimes in the United States, 
        while the other colors are worn by men of many nationalities. Women's dress shoes come in a variety of colors and may also match the 
        color of the gown, dress or suit being worn.

        <h2>Athletic Shoes:</h2>
        <p>Often referred to as sneakers or tennis shoes, depending on the part of the country you're from, athletic shoes are key 
        when doing any activity with excessive movement. These are recommended for most sports, outdoor activities like hiking/trekking,
        and of course any gym exercise. There are different types of athletic shoes for specialized activity such as cross-trainers, 
        running shoes, and basketball shoes, which usually have a high-top to help prevent ankle injuries. Top sneaker manufacturers are: </p>
